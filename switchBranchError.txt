1-Create this file ( fastForwardBranch ).
2-Change this file.
3-Don't stage Changes.
4-Try to switch branches $git checkout master
5-See what is going to happen ( checking wether we could switch branches while we have untracked files or not ).
6-TYPE [ ESC :wq ] to quit and save.
Conclusion: everything seems to work just fine ( either we are wrong about the whole thing or we are missing something ).
