Famous people answer the ubiquitous question, "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

TEACHER: To get to the other side.

PLATO: For the greater good.

ARISTOTLE: It is in the nature of chickens to cross roads.

SOCRATES: Why do you think the chicken crossed the road?

HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.

KARL MARX: It was an historical inevitability.

MILES DAVIS: That chicken was a motherfucker.

EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

BUDDHA: Asking this question denies you, your own chicken nature.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It
transcended it.

CHARLES DICKENS: It was a far, far better road that he crossed than he had ever crossed before...

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE: But soft, what bird on yonder asphalt trots?

DARWIN:  Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally  selected in  such a way that they are now genetically disposed to cross  roads.

DARWIN'S NEPHEW: Which came first, the chicken or the road?

BILL GATES:  I have just released the new Chicken Office 2020,  which will not only  cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important  documents, and  balance your checkbook.

OLIVER STONE: The question is not,  "Why did the chicken cross the  road?" Rather, it is, "Who was crossing  the road at the same time, whom  we overlooked in our haste to observe  the chicken crossing?"

FREUD: The fact that you are at all  concerned that the chicken  crossed the road reveals your underlying  sexual insecurity. You see, to  you the road represents the barrier  between what is and what might be.  What is…is you in front of the  computer screen, practicing celibacy,  peering into your mother's womb,  wishing to be suckled at her breast (in  this case, at the teats of  internet knowledge and passive acceptance),  hating the reflection in  the screen that reminds you of your father,  thinking how you life can  never measure up… What might be, only the  chicken knows, now that he  has crossed...

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be  free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.

BILL CLINTON: I feel that chicken's pain as he struggles to make the decision whether or not to cross the road...
[MONICA LEWINSKY: The chicken's pain isn't the only thing he felt.]
BILL CLINTON'S REPLY: That depends on how you define "chicken."

DAVID COPPERFIELD: I made the chicken disappear and reappear on the other side.

ACCENTURE CONSULTING:  Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road  was threatening its  dominant market position. The chicken was faced with  significant  challenges to create and develop the competencies required  for the  newly competitive market. Accenture Consulting, in a partnering   relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its   physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the   Poultry Integration Model (PIM), Accenture helped the chicken use its   skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the   chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall   strategy within a Program Management framework. Accenture Consulting   convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens   along with Accenture's consultants with deep skills in the  transportation  industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in  order to  leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and  explicit, and  to enable them to synergize with each other in order to  achieve the  implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecture  and  implement an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum  of  poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like   setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was   strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent,   clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's   mission, vision, and core values. This was conducive towards the   creation of a total business integration solution. Accenture Consulting   helped the chicken to become more successful.

MICHAEL SCHUMACHER: (Splat!) Oh, sorry. Was that a chicken?
