NOTE : Why are we creating this file ?
       Because this time we want to make a recursive merge so we need to change master after creating the recursiveMergeBranch and after we
       have made the following commits of it :
       Create recursiveMergeBranch and recursiveMergeBranch.txt Change it( recursiveMergeBranch 1st commit )
       Change recursiveMergeBranch.txt ( recursiveMergeBranch 2nd commit )
       Make recursiveMergeBranch a remote one and change recursiveMergeBranch.txt (recursiveMergeBranch 3rd commit )
